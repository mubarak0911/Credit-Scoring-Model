# Credit-Scoring-Model
**INTRODUCTION:-**

A credit scoring model using machine learning is a smart way to predict whether someone will repay a loan or credit card bill on time. Banks and financial companies use it to decide who gets approved for credit.

**How It Works:**
- Collect Data: The model looks at past information about borrowers, like their income, loan history, credit card usage, and payment habits.
- Train the Model: Using machine learning, the model learns patterns from past data. For example, it might notice that people with a long credit history and regular payments are more likely to repay a loan.
- Predict Credit Scores: When a new person applies for credit, the model uses what it learned to predict their credit score. A high score means they're likely to repay on time, while a low score means they might struggle.
  
**Why Use Machine Learning?**
- It can analyze huge amounts of data faster than humans.
- It finds complex patterns that traditional scoring methods might miss.
- It helps reduce bias by focusing on facts rather than human judgment.
